### Description  
In this project, we were tasked with creating a README generator that dynamically created a new README document based on the input of the user.


After completing these initial tasks. I worked on hitting all the points outlined in the grading criteria.   

I made sure all the links functioned properly. As well as, included outside links to a demo of the application, the GitHub repository for the application, and a link to the README generated from the application. 

### Installation

To start you must first install the required dependencies using the command ``` npm install ``` in the command line interface.   

### Usage

To begin utilizing the application, runn the ``` node index.js ``` command in the terminal. You will then be prompted with several questions that will help dynamically build out the the new README. Once these questions are completed, you should receive a "Success!" message in the terminal. This will let you know that the new exREADME.md file was created with working links to the license chosen and the GitHub of the username provided.
